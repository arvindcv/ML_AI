# Objective
#### The objective of this Capstone project is to perform sentiment analysis of tweets. 
#### The effort is towards building a model which should be able to predict if a incoming tweet can be classified as a tweet which has sentiment towards indicating occurrence of disaster. e.g. I live on the pacific coast. a level 5 hurricane is heading towards our town.

## There are multiple uses of this project 
#### There are multiple uses of this effort 
#### 1. It can be used to proactively get hints of disasters before they can happen.
#### 2. It can be used by news agencies to know where possibly they need coverage.
#### 3. The model can be used for other sentiment analysis like customer support to know if there customer is happy or unhappy with their experience.
#### 4. The model can also be used for searching web to gather posts on a particular topic and weigh the sentiment across posts e.g. restaurants reviews, product reviews, company service reviews etc.

# Approach
###  The project attempts to build following models :-
#### 1. Model which uses Count Vectorizer and Stemmer along with Logistic Regression.
#### 2. Model which uses Count Vectorizer and Lemmetizer along with Logistic Regression.
#### 3. Model using Google Bert to predict the sentiment of tweets.

# Analysis and Finding
#### 1. Logistic Regression has been considered as it has proven to be performing better along with Count Vectorizer for NLP classification problems.
#### 2. Between Stemmer and Lemmetizer, the combination of Lemmetizer with Count Vectorizer and Logistic Regression has shown to produce the best accuracy amongst other models.
#### 3. Accuracy of the model on raw tweet data has been observed to be 0.79
#### 4. Class imbalance has been observed with negatives being more in the available sample hence SMOTE has been used to over sample the data to balance the class.
#### 5. Accuracy of the model on balanced class shot up to 0.9748 after balancing the class.
#### 6. Accuracy of the model after applying gridsearchCV has been best at 0.9961
#### 7. Google Bert has been trained and an accuracy of 0.9998 has been observed with it.
#### 8. Hyper parameters used for tuning - 
		max_iter=[1,10,1000]
		solvers = ['newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear']
		penalty = ['l2']
		c_values = [100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, 0.01]
#### 9. GridSearchCV has been the most accurate model and the slowest one w.r.t fitting time.
